# R_data_tutorial
Simple tutorial in R to accelerate understanding in data manipulation for researchers. Specifically geared towards those who have had experience in another coding language (e.g., SAS, STATA, python) or who need a refresher in R (e.g., you've taken a coding course before but that was years ago).

## Running the file
- Download [R tutorial.qmd](https://github.com/reigningforest/R_data_tutorial/blob/main/R%20tutorial.qmd) and [lung_cancer_examples.csv](https://github.com/reigningforest/R_data_tutorial/blob/main/lung_cancer_examples.csv)
- All libraries/packages needed are within one of the code blocks in the [R tutorial.qmd](https://github.com/reigningforest/R_data_tutorial/blob/main/R%20tutorial.qmd)

## A Couple Notes:
- This was created with the intention of speed of application. It is my opinion that you should understand the code that you get from chatgpt. Otherwise, you may get unnoticed deletions or errors in your results, which is never good!
- This tutorial is very much geared towards using dplyr's (a library/package within R) functions for ease of interpretability and use.
- You must have R and an IDE installed (e.g. RStudio). You can download here: [R and Rstudio Download Link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
