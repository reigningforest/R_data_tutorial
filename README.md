# R_data_tutorial
Simple tutorial in R to accelerate understanding in data manipulation for researchers. Specifically geared towards those who have had experience in another coding language (e.g., SAS, STATA, python) or who need a refresher in R (e.g., you've taken a coding course before but that was years ago).

## A Couple Notes:
- This was created with the intention of speed of application while also balancing some understanding of data manipulation. It is my opinion that you should understand the code that you put into chatgpt. Otherwise, you may get unnoticed deletions or errors in your results.
- This tutorial is very much geared towards using dplyr's (a library/package within R) functions for ease of interpretability and use.
- You must have R and an IDE installed (e.g. RStudio). You can download here: [R and Rstudio Download Link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
